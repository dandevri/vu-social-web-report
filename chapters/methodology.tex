\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data collection (datasets)}

To gather social web data from Mastodon the official public Mastodon API \footnote{https://docs.joinmastodon.org/client/intro/} using the Mastodon.py \footnote{https://mastodonpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/}wrapper for Python is used. Mastodon is an ActivityPub-based \footnote{https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/} Twitter-like federated social network node. The API wrapper is feature complete for Mastodon the Mastodon API version 3.5.5. First a user account is created on the platform by completing the sign-up for an account flow on the Mastodon official website \textit{joingmastodon.org}. The account is created on the general and largest public server (provider) \textit{mastodon.social} operated by the Mastodon gGmbH non-profit.

To interact with the Mastodon servers through Python using the Mastodon.py wrapper an application registration is performed which gives a client key and client secret to allow logging in and accessing API data using access tokens. For this research we mainly used API methods for:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Accounts, relationships and lists:} allows for geting information about accounts and associated data as well as update that data
  \item \textbf{Instance-wide data and search:}  fetch information associated with the current instance as well as data from the instance-wide profile directory
  \item \textbf{Streaming:} allow access to the streaming API. For the public, local and hashtag streams,
\end{itemize}

Arguments and parameters used in functions written for the Mastodon API methods are related to the dutch elections (e.g. names of political candidates, popular topics from parties) further expanded upon in the data preprocessing and results section of this research. To check, validate and cross-reference the sub-questions the data is complementend with five additional election related data sources: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Institut Public de Sondage d'Opinion Secteur (IPSOS) exitpoll:} a market research company which, commisioned by the 'Nederlandse Omroep Stichting' \footnote{https://nos.nl/} (NOS; English: Dutch Broadcasting Foundation) publishes market research about the elections (e.g. which voters switch between parties, which municipilaties has switched the most between parties) \cite{nos}. This gives a comprehensive insight of voting behaviour from the recent election.
  \item \textbf{Government Open Data (overheid.nl)}: specifically the datasets from The Dutch Electoral Council \footnote{https://www.kiesraad.nl/} (Dutch: Kiesraad), the government body that is responsibly for counting of the votes and publishing the results \cite{kiesraad}. This gives the official results of parties and candidates from the recent elections.
  \item \textbf{ProDemos voting guide (stemwijzer)}: a voting guide called Stemwijzer \footnote{https://home.stemwijzer.nl/} with pre-defined topics. By answering 30 statements with agree, disagree or no opinion, voters can compare their positions with those of political parties. Many of these voting guides exist, ProDemos is most requested and partly funded by the dutch government \cite{prodemos}. This gives insight in important topics from political parties for the recent elections.
  \item \textbf{Electoral Council (kiesraad)}: the Kiesraad \footnote{https://english.kiesraad.nl/} is a central electoral committee, an advisory body and acts as a central polling station during the dutch house of representatives election. For this research we used the published Candidacy for the House of Representatives election list and the Political Party Registrar.
  \item \textbf{Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (cpb)}: the dutch economics bureau (CPB) \footnote{https://www.cpb.nl/en/charted-choices-2025-2028} performs election manifestos analysis to determine how feasible manifestos of political parties are. This gives an overview of topics that are in the election manifestos of political parties.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data preprocessing (scope)}

From the dutch-election gathered data sources first a relevant scope for this research is determined. For a datetime timeline of data we use data from Mastodon's initial release of 16 March 2016 (7 years ago). This means we analyse three House of Representatives elections. In 2017 with a turn-out rate of 81,57\% of dutch population, in 2021 with a turn-out rate of 78,71\% of dutch population and the most recent as of writing this paper in 2023 with a turn-out rate of 77,75\% of dutch population. Usually dutch elections take place every four years (thus next elections  had been expected to be held in 2025) but a snap election was called after the fourth Rutte cabinet collapsed due to immigration policy disagreements between the coalition parties.

In total during this timeframe a total of 42 unique parties could be voted on during the elections. 28 parties in 2017, 37 parties in 2021 and 26 parties in 2023. For this research we created a subset of political parties based on incumbent parties ('zittende partijen' in dutch) based on the results of most recent and previous elections. This gives a total of 20 parties. This research also has taken synonyms and abbreviations of parties into account (e.g. Forum voor Democratie is often abbreviated to 'FvD' or GL-PvdA is still often mentioned with full names after the merger in 2022 as Groenlinks and Partij voor de Arbied) \textit{Table \ref{party-table}} displays an overview of parties used for this research. For analysis of topics we mannually created an aggregated dataset, as shown in \textit{Table \ref{topic-table}} of main topics and potential subtopics based on the topics mentioned in the voting guide and analysis of the election manifestos of the CPB.  \\

\subsection{Data analysis}

This research focusses on Network Analysis which is performed using the Python programming language (latest stable version 3.12.0) following the Jupyter \footnote{https://jupyter.org/} notebook standard to which combines code, documentation, data, and visualizations. Besides the Mastodon.py API wrapper to access the Mastodon data the notebooks use NetworkX \footnote{https://networkx.org/} to perform Network Analysis. This library allows for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks and has built-in functions for common analysis measurements and displaying graphs. To display data  plot distributions, and creating visualizations a combination of Matplotlib \footnote{https://matplotlib.org/} and Seaborn \footnote{https://seaborn.pydata.org/} are used.
