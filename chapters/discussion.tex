Privacy \& ethical considerations mainly for our research project on Mastodon \\ 


Besides these considerations specifically for this research, in general it is becoming increasingly more difficult to investigate the social web and user-generated content and metadata due to several privacy schandals related to social networking platforms. Big Data Graph API's access are being heavily restricted and only available after extensive authorisation (e.g. Facebook Graph API after the Cambridge Analytica scandal \cite{cambridge}) and real-time streaming API's access is being rate limited, paywalled or blocked entirely due to fear of AI scraping (e.g. Twitter rate limited their API \cite{twitter}, developers need to pay for Reddit API usage \cite{reddit}).
