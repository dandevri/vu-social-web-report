## Description

Written report for the social web course for the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

## Abstract

> Prior to elections viewpoints of parties of various users are
often expressed on Social Networking Sites (SNS) since expressing opinion
is one of the core characteristics of social media. Recently on November
2023 elections for the Dutch House of Representatives took place. This
study focuses on on a data-driven social web approach aiming to answer
the research question: to what extent is the relatively new SNS ’Mastodon’
representative of the election voting of the Dutch population? In the
analysis phase of this research, processed data from several election-related resources such as political parties and topics from election manifestos
are cross-referenced and statistically analysed with Mastodon instance-wide (e.g. servers) and Streaming API (e.g. toots and mentions). The
results indicated that there is a significant increase in activity related to
the Dutch election on the Mastodon platform and political parties and
candidates are increasingly creating user accounts and instances. Privacy
and ethical considerations when accessing Mastodon platform data are
discussed and in the future work section, the study addresses several
further enhancements that can be performed to automate more of the
processing methods and to further expand the election data sources use
